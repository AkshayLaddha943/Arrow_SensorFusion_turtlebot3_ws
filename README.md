# Arrow_SensorFusion_turtlebot3

This repository encapsulates my ROS workspace containing the necessary packages and program nodes to simulate a simple turtlebot3 and further performing SLAM on turtlebot3 whilst adding noise to wheel odometry sensor motion model and IMU sensor, results folder containing images and videos of simulation of turtlebot3 for different situations and a documentation as part of my Internship with Arrow Electronics (eInfochips).

## Pre-requirements

The simulation requires the following libraries and packages to be installed

- [ROS2 (Foxy)](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html)

- [turtlebot3](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3)

- [robot_localization](http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/robot_localization/html/index.html)

- [navigation2](https://navigation.ros.org/)

- [Python 3.6.x - Python 3.8.x](https://www.python.org/)


## Simulating the turtlebot3

* Download the Cornell grasp dataset:  [Cornell grasp dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oneoneliu/cornell-grasp)

* Pre-trained model for the evaluation can be downloaded from here: [Resnet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ldapcpanzqdu7tc/models.zip?dl=0)
